# Mac dotfiles

## Neovim configuration

Remember to install vimplug with

```bash
curl -fLo ~/.config/nvim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

Some plugins require python support. It's important.

```bash
brew install python
/usr/local/bin/pip install neovim
/usr/local/bin/pip install --upgrade neovim
```
